# FSharpLu F# library

This library provides F# lightweight utilities for string manipulations, logging, collection data structures, file operations, text processing, security, async, parsing, diagnostics, configuration files and Json serialization.

This is by no means a full-fledged utility library for F#, but rather a small collection of utilities and other thin wrappers accumulated throughout the development of various internal projects at Microsoft and meant to facilitate development with the .Net framework using the F# programming language.

Some of the provided utilities are just thin `let`-bindings wrappers around existing .Net libraries (e.g. module `FSharpLu.Text` or `FSharpLu.Parsing`) whereas some provide additional features (e.g. Json serialization in module `FSharpLu.Json`).
