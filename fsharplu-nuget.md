This library provides F# lightweight utilities for string manipulations, logging, collection data structures, file operations, text processing, security, async, parsing, diagnostics, configuration files and Json serialization.
This is by no means a full-fledged utility library for F#, but rather a small collection of utilities and other thin wrappers accumulated throughout the development of various internal projects at Microsoft and meant to facilitate development with the .Net framework using the F# programming language.
Some of the provided utilities are just thin let-bindings wrappers around existing .Net libraries (e.g. module FSharpLu.Text or FSharpLu.Parsing) whereas some provide additional features (e.g. Json serialization in module FSharpLu.Json).
